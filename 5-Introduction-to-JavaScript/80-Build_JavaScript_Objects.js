//Learned to build an object, which are similar to an array, but use data in objects with what are called properties. Useful for storing data in a structured way.
//Using objects you can describe something.
// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name" : "Fido",
  "legs" : 4,
  "tails" : 1,
  "friends": ["Dogs", "Everyone"]



};
