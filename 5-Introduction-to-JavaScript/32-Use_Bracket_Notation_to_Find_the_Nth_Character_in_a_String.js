//Learned to use bracket notation to find the nth character in a string.
//Important note: computers start at 0 so make sure to subract the number of characters by one.
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var secondLetterOfFirstName = firstName[1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var thirdLetterOfLastName = lastName[2];
