//Learned to use bracket notation to find the nth to last character in a string. Code: [(variable).lenght-n] where n is the number back.
//It is important to know that here the computer doesnt count 0 as a number.
// Example
var firstName = "Ada";
var lastLetterOfFirstName = firstName[firstName.length - 1];

// Setup
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.
var lastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length-1];
